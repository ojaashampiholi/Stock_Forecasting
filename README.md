This Project is based on Stock Market Predictions using Traditional Time Series Analysis method - Vector Autoregression (VAR) and a modern Deep Learning based approach built using Recurrent Neural Networks.
The RNN model uses Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) unit as the basic building block.
The data for the project is being used from the Alpha_Vantage API, which requires the user to sign up using an email Id and thereafter is free to use - https://www.alphavantage.co/
